# Playground Engine

It is a experimental code base for RPG 3D games. The aim of this is a implement the most common and useful games systems, objects and logics with the full care about architecture, good patterns and code smells.

I hope it will systematically grow and develop this will be instructive.

## Notes

- The Unity prefabs, scenes will be published in separated demo scene repo, I would like to keep here only a common code base.

## Collaborate

I would like to get ideas, tips & opinion about code, architecture and features from You!
