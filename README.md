# Goo - workspace

It is a experimental code base especially for 3D games. The idea for this project is implementing the most common and useful games systems, objects and logics with the full care about architecture, good patterns and code smells.
I hope it will systematically grow and develop this will be instructive.

All fairly finished packages can be downloaded separately in separate packages.

Code is totally **work in progress** so... You can join to creating this!

## Separated packages

- [Goo](https://github.com/goorkamateusz/GooSaves) - Base tool box and patterns for Unity;
- [GooSaves](https://github.com/goorkamateusz/GooSaves) - My implementation of JSON-based saves;

## Documentation

Link to documentation: [https://goorkamateusz.github.io/GooUnity](https://goorkamateusz.github.io/GooUnity).

## Notes

- The Unity prefabs, scenes will be published in separated demo scene repo, I would like to keep here only a code.

## Collaborate

I would like to get ideas, tips & opinion about code, architecture and features from You!
